# Hello There

I am a fourth year computer science student at Epitech. Linux, FOSS, Homelabbing and tinkering with my system is what I spend my time on.

Some projects I worked on are:

- [A virtual arcade machine with switching of graphical backend at runtime](https://github.com/Nydragon/Arcade)
- [A basic Scheme Interpeter](https://github.com/Nydragon/GLaDOS-2023)
- [An R-Type like multiplayer sidescroller](https://github.com/Epitech-R-Type/R-Type)
